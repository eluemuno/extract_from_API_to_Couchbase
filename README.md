# extract_from_API_to_Couchbase

This is a simple integration of the fantastic Sherpa API procedure endpoint to a couchbase DB. THe intent of this is to show how fantastic the Python language is and how well detailed the Sherpa (https://www.joinsherpa.com) API is too. 

I do this to improve my skill-set and show how far I have gone.

Please feel free to use, I will be making updates as I learn...
